# Report of this Project

## Introduction:
This project is to summarize the data by giving it a data visualization for the number of occurrences in any factor based on the given ID.
The assumptions I have made in this project since this project supports GUI. With User input we could have a histogram of any UUID and generate the result for any factor.

## Requirements checklist:
1. The project is coded with Python programming language with version 3.0. Checklist for 1. The program takes UUID as User input and takes a task from the user to generate the histogram.

2. There are various options for the user to choose what they want. Histogram for the number of countries viewed or Histogram for the number of continents viewed, Checklist for 2

3. Histogram for the number of browsers viewed. From the user it can present the result with either the version of the browser or the name of the browser. Checklist for 3

4. During the launch of the program, the program asks for the UUID from the User input and the task for what histogram they want.

5. Get top 10 readers. Checklist for 4

6. Get top 10 documents. Checklist for 5d.

7. Command line usage for all the above operations. Checklist for 6

## Design Consideration:

After the launch of the program, the user will be asked to write a valid UUID and choose among the options what histogram they need. In case if the user writes an invalid UUID or leaves the box empty and clicks on the option. It will throw a error message "Invaid UUID"
